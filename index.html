        <h2 class="secHeading">Fashion Time!</h2>
        <p class="text">
          The sheer variety of men's fashion trends aggregated below reflect
          that sentiment. Is everything here going to tickle your fancy? Eh,
          probably notâ€”but that's totally okay. Think of this list less like
          commandments handed down from on high (thou shalt not covet thy
          neighbor's sweater, indeed) and more like a snapshot of the freakiest,
          flyest menswear moves we're itching to give a try this year, from the
          fluffy toques keeping our noggins cozy now to the weirdo slip-ons
          we'll be nestling our piggies in all spring. Let's leave the
          soothsaying to the hapless number-crunchers in Cupertino, shall we?
          There ain't an algorithm in the world able to approximate this
          pizzazz.
